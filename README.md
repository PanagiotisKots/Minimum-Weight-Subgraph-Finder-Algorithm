# Minimum-Weight-Subgraph-Finder-Algorithm
Efficient Java Solution to Compute the Optimal Subgraph in Weighted Directed Graphs


Description

This repository provides a Java implementation of an algorithm to find the minimum weight subgraph in a weighted directed graph, ensuring connectivity from two distinct source nodes to a single destination node. The solution uses Dijkstra's algorithm for efficient shortest path computations and supports large graphs with up to 105105 nodes and edges. Ideal for learning graph theory concepts, optimizing graph-related problems, and practical applications in network routing.
